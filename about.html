        <p>
            The Gonzalez Art Foundation is a 501(c)(3) private foundation dedicated to the preservation and proliferation of art.
            We accomplish our mission by archiving works of art that are publicly accessible
            and making high resolution copies available on our site with a powerful search engine and minimalist image viewer.

        <h2>Using This Site</h2>
        <h3>Prices</h3>
        <p>
            Art from auction houses will have prices and timestamps.
            The price represent the auction close price.
            The timestamp represents when gonzalez art foundation indexed the image and captured the price.
            The timestamp will always be after the auction close date and doesn't represent the date of the auction close.
            For example this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gonzalez-art-foundation.org/gallery.html?source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christies.com&pageId=108617">Rolex Chronograph</a> from Christies has a timestamp indicating it was indexed by gonzalez art foundation on February 27th, 2021
            and an auction close date of December 10th, 2020.
            Prices displayed are only one tool that can be used to estimate the current market price.
            The current market price will always vary from the moment after the auction close.
            It's even possible the item was resold and the price isn't the latest historical price with a new more current market price being realized at a later point in time.
