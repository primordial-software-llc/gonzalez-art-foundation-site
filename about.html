        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            The Gonzalez Art Foundation is dedicated to the preservation and proliferation of art.
            The foundation was founded by Timothy Gonzalez after he identified a need to more efficiently
            view hundreds of thousands of images.
        </p>
        <h2>Board of Directors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Timothy Scott Gonzalez</li>
            <li>Kiara Elsa Manrique Loyola</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preservation</h2>
        <p>
            The Gonzalez Art Foundation accomplishes its mission of preservation by crawling,
            classifying and archiving digital works of art that are publicly accessible.
        </p>
        <h2>Proliferation</h2>
        <p>
            The Gonzalez Art Foundation accomplishes its mission of proliferation by
            presenting art in a minimalist gallery.
            The image viewer is capable of presenting one image statically or quickly
            presenting many images one-by-one in a slideshow.
        </p>
