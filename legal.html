        <p>The art on this site is displayed legally without violating copyright law due to the reasons below:</p>
        <ul>

                All services on https://www.gonzalez-art-foundation.org ("this site") are provided free of cost to the public.
                "This site" doesn't engage in commerce and operates solely on donations.
                <br /><br />
                All images in the search and gallery which are presented as content and aren't used to operate "this site" are presented with "fair use" under Section 107 of the copyright act 1976,
                due to the educational and non-profit nature of this website. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107">Section 107 of the copyright act</a> states:
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>
                Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—
                <br /><br />
                <ol>
                    <li>the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
                    <li>the nature of the copyrighted work;
                    <li>the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
                    <li>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
                </ol>
                </i>
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>Under the Berne Convention, works of art by artists who have long been deceased lose their copyright with varying
                copyright lengths death depending upon the work's country of origin. In summary most works created before 1920 are in the public domain and are no longer under copyright.
                <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>According to Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.,
                unoriginal pictures of works of art in the public domain can't be copyrighted.</li>
