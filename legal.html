                <br />
                <i>
                Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—
                <br /><br />
                <ol>
                    <li>the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
                    <li>the nature of the copyrighted work;
                    <li>the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
                    <li>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

            <li>Under the Berne Convention, works of art by artists who have long been deceased lose their copyright with varying
                copyright lengths death depending upon the work's country of origin. In summary most works created before 1920 are in the public domain and are no longer under copyright.

            <li>According to Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.,

        <h2>Obscenity</h2>
        <p>
            Art on this site will depict people of all races, religions and ages in all acts of life without bias made by serious artists originating from serious art institutions.
            All artistic depictions are displayed legally under the 1st amendment's freedom of expression unless found to be obscene.

            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-obscenity">Obscenity</a> depicting adults according to the three-pronged Miller test.
            <span class="custom-blockquote">
                The U.S. Supreme Court established the test that judges and juries use to determine whether matter is obscene in three major cases: Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24-25 (1973); Smith v. United States, 431 U.S. 291, 300-02, 309 (1977); and Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, 500-01 (1987).  The three-pronged Miller test is as follows:
                <br /><br />
                <ol>
                    <li>Whether the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, finds that the matter, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interests (i.e., an erotic, lascivious, abnormal, unhealthy, degrading, shameful, or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion);</li>
                    <li>Whether the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, finds that the matter depicts or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way (i.e., ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, masturbation, excretory functions, lewd exhibition of the genitals, or sado-masochistic sexual abuse); and</li>
                    <li>Whether a reasonable person finds that the matter, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</li>
                </ol>
                Any material that satisfies this three-pronged test may be found obscene.

            <span class="custom-blockquote">
                In addition, Section 1466A of Title 18, United State Code, makes it illegal for any person to knowingly produce, distribute, receive, or possess with intent to transfer or distribute visual representations, such as drawings, cartoons, or paintings that appear to depict minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct and are deemed obscene.  This statute offers an alternative 2-pronged test for obscenity with a lower threshold than the Miller test.  The matter involving minors can be deemed obscene if it (i) depicts an image that is, or appears to be a minor engaged in graphic bestiality, sadistic or masochistic abuse, or sexual intercourse <strong>and (ii) if the image lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</strong> A first time offender convicted under this statute faces fines and at least 5 years to a maximum of 20 years in prison.
